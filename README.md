# Arduino learning

This repository contains my Arduino Uno learning journey. I'm starting with generic stuff to learn the basics, all the electronic components individually. I will also make some util classes that I think could be useful.

When those goals are reached I would like to explore bare metal programming and learn C/C++ more deeply for embedded programming.
